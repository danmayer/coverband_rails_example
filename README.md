# Coverband Rails Demo

It has been awhile since I built and hosted a Coverband Rails example app. This demo is intended to show how to get up and running with Coverband and some of the various configuration options.

* See the [Coverband Repo](https://github.com/danmayer/coverband) for documentation and more details

# Getting Started

* `git clone git@github.com:danmayer/coverband_rails_example.git`
* `bundle install`
* `bundle exec rails s`
* open: http://localhost:3000/coverage

# Demo Dependencies

* built with Rails 7.1
* Ruby 3.2.2

# TODO

* setup and ensure folks can test via docker
* deploy the docker image somewhere

# How to run the test suite

* `bundle exec rake`
